Opensource code of IEEE TMC major revision manuscript - Energy Optimization for Mobile Applications  by Exploiting 5G Inactive State

## Usage

* *Data Collection*: If you want to collect trace information of a specific application from your smartphone, you can run `collect/collect.sh`
  * Usage: raw smartphone data collection
    * use `ifconfig` to get the interface name
    * use `ps -A` to get the app PID
    * change the app name in line 32 and line 33
  * Attention: The smartphone you are using for data collection should have root user rights.
    We recommend you to try phones from brand series like Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, ZTE, Xiaomi, Oneplus, etc. as they are easy to get root user rights.
* *Trace Analyze* (Brief): If you want to analyze the trace information, you can run the code in  `analyze` folder.
  * `analyzePcap.py`: analyze the pcap file collected by `collect/collect.sh`, output an excel for packets of TCPDUMP: hour, minute, second, millisecond
  * `classification_C50.py`: the C50 prediction model of 5GSaver
  * `combineFeatures.py`: combine the different features from different Apps in the mobile phone.
  * `extractInfo.py`: output an excel for STRACE: hour, minute, second, millisecond, command, paras, return, duration
  * `extractPorts.py`: output the port information needed by 5GSaver
  * `RF_classifier.py`: RF model of 5GSaver
* *Trace Analyze* (Detail):  If you want to analyze the trace information, you can run the code in  `more_features` folder.
* *Dataset*: If you need to use our dataset for your research, you can access the `dataset` folder.
  The dataset we currently provide is used to validate and replicate our research, so we currently provide only a portion of the dataset we collected.
  We expect to provide the entire original data set of this paper at a later date to facilitate researchers' follow-up research.
* *Pre-Trained Model*: If you need to use our pretrained models for your research, you can access the pretrained folder.
  The pre-trained models we currently provide are used to verify and reproduce our research. You can also try to train the prediction model yourself.
